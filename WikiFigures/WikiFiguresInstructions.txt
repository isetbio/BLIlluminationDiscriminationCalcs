IMPORTANT: YOU MUST HAVE THE .FIG FILES

*** Generating PNG files ***

For any general figures generated by the classifier tutorials, use generateWikiFigures.m.  This will pull the .fig files (percent correct and p value) from the respective tutorial data folders, MatlabSVM_Posâ€¦ etc. and store them as PNG files in this directory.

For any other figures, such as the hyperplanes, open the .fig in matlab and use FigureSave to save it as PNG file.  Store in the desired subdirectory in WikiFigures.

*** Linking to images on GitHub ***

Once you have your PNG's, go onto the Github website.  On the code page, navigate to your PNG files.  When you open a PNG, on the top right of the image window, there should be a button called 'RAW'.  Click on this and use the URL to which it redirects you as the link for adding an image on a wiki page.
