# BLIlluminationDiscriminationCalcs
BrainardLab Illumination Discrimination Calculations

This repository contains code that will, eventually, implement a computational observer model for illumination discrimination calculations being done by the Brainard Lab, to model results of experiments that are collaborative between the Hurlbert and Brainard laboratories.
